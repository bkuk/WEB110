There was a lot to learn from session 6. To start, Voice Internet Protocol (VoIP) is basically using the phone connections through
the internet. This is overall cheaper and more efficient than using phone lines, so this is a great way to collaborate with others
with services like Google Hangout or Skype. However, there are some services that you can only interact with the same service. This
is sort of like having a walkie talkie that can only connect to the same kind of walkie talkie. However, this does not deny that
services like Google Hangouts is a great way to have a meeting from a distance. In another activity, it breaks down screen sharing
or remote desktop control. This is the process of controlling a computer from another computer. One can benefit from being able to
access, say, a home computer from afar. For example, if your home computer is more powerful than a laptop and you have local files
on the home computer, then it would just be easier to work on that computer. This can be done through different screen sharing
services. Another application is that some IT companies will want to help you through these screen sharing services. However,
this can be dangerous because there have been scammers known to do this and take others personal information. The most interesting
activity was the FTP portion. FTP stands for file transfer protocol, and it has a very literal definition. This is a client meant
for transferring files from one computer to another, which is a process for creating websites. With an FTP, someone can transfer
the files for a website to send it to another computer (the server). Websites have servers that they are hosted on, which are other
computers. So, to be able to create a website on a machine that is not even physically there is quite incredible.
