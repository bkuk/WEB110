<p>In this lesson, we were prompted to create a CSS stylesheet for our index.html. Something that was interesting to me was connecting these two files. I knew that these two languages were used together for websites, however I had no idea that they were two connected files. I had always thought they were always written in the same file. The activities in this chapter prompted us to tinker with different aspects of formatting a website. One of the attributes that was interesting to see was changing the color for elements. I looked up different HTML color codes, and there are websites dedicated for a library of HTML codes. One website I found was basically a big color wheel with different switches to change the tone of the colors. It is cool to know that if we want to use a general color, like white, we can simply just type in white. But, if we want to access a rather specific color, maybe maroon, we would need to look up a color code for this. And this applies to any type of color change. Something else that was cool was the alignment of a page. In one of the videos, it shows us a model of a website. A website is pretty much made up of boxes and it is CSSâ€™s job to organize those boxes. Alignment can be tricky and everything may not align correctly the first time. That is why it is important to be as symmetrical as possible, if it calls for it. On paper, CSS does not sound so complicated. It makes sense to me that if we tell the body that the color is going to be white, it will be white. But, I feel like once we start applying this to larger scale projects, it is going to get much more complicated.</p>
