Google is probably the most popular search engine that everyone uses. Google is an index that searches the web using something called spiders.
These spiders will connect to links connecting to links to find the information that best suits what you search for. However, Google really
thinks about how they pull that information. How many times does it use the key phrases you’re looking for? How many different pages link it?
How many people use it? Is it spam? Basically, it will look for the most popular source and link you to that page. What’s also interesting is
you can use Boolean operators to search. Using AND and OR is actually a built in operation, but when you use it, you can group the words together
to specify your search. This is not limited to Boolean operators. There are other ways to specify your search, such as identifying the domain.
For example, you can search for websites that are only hosted on websites that contain .gov. Search engines may have the same purpose, but
they all don’t work the same. They all have different algorithms that make them unique. Google is popular because it has the most efficient
algorithm to find what you are looking for. However, this is also something that other websites will think about. They will think about the
best way to appear in searches so they are known. This is called Search Engine Optimization. This basically means that websites want to do
everything they can to be on the top of that search page; from using key phrases to having a good design. There are even websites that go out
of their way to force their searches to become popular. For example, sometimes a website may create many other websites. These other websites
will create links to the main one, tricking the search engines that this is a popular site. In one of the activities, I compared the search
engines side by side. I searched, “the fastest car in the world.” They all gave me different results. Google has this feature that will usually
display the answer to a question at the top of the screen, however the rest of the search engines gave me different articles telling me the top
ten fastest cars in the world. After searching market share valuefor these search engines, Google had the highest one. There is a reason that
everyone uses Google, and it’s interesting to learn why.
