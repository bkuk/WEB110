            In this session, we were introduced to SQL (Structured Query Language). This chapter was a bit confusing for me, but I’ll try my best to summarize what I learned. So, this lesson was mainly focused on databases and SQL. A database is a collection of data that we can use to store, manipulate, etc. This moved into database management systems, which is a software that lets us access those databases. This includes software like mySQL. We were then introduced to different SQL phrases. This is what the activities were about. We were asked to do activities from different online schooling websites and familiarize ourselves with the SQL phrases. For example, SELECT and FROM are two statements that are often used together. In the activities, we used different variations of SELECT and FROM to understand what it is doing. From what I understand, SELECT will select the data from a database and create columns from this data. FROM will ask, “From where are we getting this data from?” FROM will then add the data from where it is pointing to. Now, from what I understand, we can do much more than just this. We can use phrases like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to modify these tables that we are getting from the database. This is interesting to me because I’m also taking a class where I’m learning Python. We just finished the chapter that involved arrays, which are basically just lists of different elements of data. It’s interesting to see a different language deal with this sort of problem as well.
