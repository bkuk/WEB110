This chapter, I have to say, was the most interactive chapter yet. I really enjoyed watching the videos and learning
the nit and grit of how the Internet works. One video I really enjoyed involved one of the co-founders of the Internet,
and how he still works on it to this day. I would have to say that my main takeaway from this lesson would have to be
understanding how data is moved around from computer to computer, through the internet. TCP was a very important concept
in this chapter, and this stands for Transmission Control Protocol. The TCP is responsible for managing sending and
receiving data and moving them through packets. Those packets are then sent to its destination, and the TCP will recognize
if all the data was sent. If not, it results in a buffer, and waits for that information to come through. Another important
concept I think was about the OSI model. The OSI model basically helps IT professionals identify a problem. There are seven
layers to the model, and IT workers will use this model to pinpoint exactly what the problem is, and then find it on the
corresponding model. This is so they know what kind of problem it is, but does not necessarily help them solve the problem.
These activities were also very interesting. I chose to do the activity that verifies your Internet connection and the OSI game.
The connection activity was a fun one. I did most of my work in the command window of my computer, and it basically asked us
to check for internet connection of IP addresses. It was interesting to see how fast a website like Google can load. Watching
how fast it was and how many steps it took to get there was very surprising to me. The OSI game was a tricky one because of the
different problems that were thrown into the game. There were some terms and phrases that I really did not know, and that sort
of hindered me from playing the game. I tried my best and some of the words I knew surprised me, in terms of which layer it actually
belonged in.
