Internet safety is very important today. Most of what we all do is going to be on the Internet, and it
contains a lot of private information. If a computer is compromised, anyone can do anything with any of
the information on that computer. There are many ways that a hacker can acquire someone else’s information,
and it is usually done in mass quantities. For example, a common thing that everyone looks out for on the
Internet is spam email. Spam can contain a bad link, or trick someone into thinking something else. People
on the Internet are gullible, so when they are told that their computer has a virus, they are going to trust
the computer. People should always be looking out for these kinds of signs on the Internet, and there are tools
to help with this. One of the activities involves testing your computer for malware. There are plenty of
anti-virus programs out there today. These programs will scan and check for any irregularities in your computer
and try to clean it up. Another activity talks about password managers. This is interesting because I actually
use a Google Chrome extension called LastPass. This is a password manager and generator. It can generate a long,
complicated password, as well as store that password so I won’t have to memorize it every time. This really helps
manage all of my passwords, it’s sort of a password bank. As well as this, I will try to use at least a two step
verification process when logging into my different accounts. Today, you can’t be too safe with information. Having
a multi-step verification process will simply verify that it is you that logged in, multiple times. Since computers
are getting faster, they are also getting smarter in all aspects. This makes me feel very unsafe at times, but this
is where most people spend their lives now.
