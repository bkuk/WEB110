The first web browser I used growing up was Internet Explorer. It was really the only one anyone used if they had a PC. Then,
more and more started to pop up. Like Firefox or Google Chrome. Today, I use Google Chrome as my primary web browser. Mainly
because I like the overall user interface, it’s easy to use, and the design is smooth. However, I just prefer this one. Most
browsers are going to have the same functions. They all have a refresh button, back/forward buttons, etc. A web browser is used
to retrieve, present, and traverse information on the World Wide Web. This means that if you want to do anything to connect to the
World Wide Web, you need to use a web browser. When accessing a web site, the browser will read a URI and this determines how the
URL will be interpreted. The web page will then send HTML and other content through it’s system and change the languages into
interactive material. Most web pages will be made up of more than HTML. In one of the activities, there is a website that shows
the accessibility of HTML in web browsers. It was interesting to me that Edge 16 was 100 percent accessible and Google
Chrome was only 92% accessible. From what I understand from the article, this means that Chrome is not entirely made up of HTML,
but has incorporated other languages into the page. Such as Javascript or CSS. Browsers can also have extensions. Extensions are just
modular tools of a web browser. For example, many people will install ad-block onto their browser. Ad-block is an extension that will block
off any ads on a page, and make them invisible to the user. They have a nice page on how it works, and to generalize, they said that they
will match any ad patterns and simply make it so the webpage will display nothing instead of an ad. This is just one example of an extension,
they have extensions for almost anything. It’s almost like an application for the phone, except for web browsers.
