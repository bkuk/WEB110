    The internet is a vast sea of data that everyone can use, with the right connection. People use it for almost anything:
entertainment, business, school, etc. Internet connections are based on wired connections, which can lead to wireless 
connections. Even the wifi router has to be plugged in. When approaching a website, the computer will request information 
from a server. This is where the websites are stored. The server will then send the correct information to the computer. 
Something interesting that came from the internet is cloud storage. The cloud is pretty much just another way to store data. 
Instead of directly storing data onto your computers hard drive, one can store data into the cloud which is just usually just 
an internet server. This is a great tool to share files. For example, Google Drive is a great cloud storage. I use it to share 
files with my friends and family, or just to create room on my computer. It’s another great way to back up data. This means 
your data can be stored and saved, in case there is corruption or just damaged data. To access the internet, we use a web 
browser. This includes browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari (for Apple users), Internet Explorer, and many more. At the 
top of every browser, a URL must be entered. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. This is pretty much the “address” of 
the website you are trying to reach. Every URL begins with a scheme. This is typically the http or the https at the beginning 
of the URL. This will then be followed by the domain name. The domain name is the name of the website. For example www.google.com 
would be the domain name for Google. Each of the parts of the domain name have a purpose. The www is the sub-domain, google is 
the second level, and .com is the top level. The top level indicates what kind of website you are reaching. There are different 
top levels that one can use, like: .org, .gov, .edu, etc. This usually indicates what kind of organization, business, institution, 
etc. you are trying to reach.
    An IP address stands for Internet Protocol. The address is a unique number that is linked to all your online activity. 
This is one of the network protocols that your computer uses to deliver and receive information. It will pretty much give 
each of your actions an address when you do something on the computer. IP addresses are not specific to the computer you are 
working on. They are different based on the network that you are connected to. For example, your home IP address is going to 
be different from the one you use at your local coffee shop. This can also help with constructing certain regulations for a 
website. A website’s functionality may differ, based on the IP address. A site may even block certain countries from visiting 
their website through their IP address. However, it can also work the opposite way. People can track IP addresses and use them 
for spamming purposes. This is a very common occurrence. For example, emails spam is very common. Although people may be able 
to find your computer, it is a bit more difficult to find your exact location through your device. There are websites that 
can check your IP address for your location, and other services will sometimes give you a general location for when you are 
using their product. For example, I use Netflix. Every time someone logs into Netflix on a new device, I will receive an email 
asking me if this was ok. It will also give me a general location of where the device is being used. It will tell me that someone 
in Illinois is using the account. The email will never give me a location too specific. IP addresses are also used by law 
enforcement. They will work with inter service providers to see what kind of illegal media/information is being moved on 
the internet.
    Traceroute is a command-line tool within the Windows operating system. This is a tool used to understand Internet connection 
and what may be wrong. When you connect to a website, you will be connected to your router, then the internet provider, then 
an even bigger system. There are pathways that your computer must take to retrieve or put out data. Traceroute can show us the 
path that the computer is taking. This can show us if something went wrong in certain paths. On Windows, traceroute is run 
through a command prompt/terminal. When this is executed, the terminal will display a list of speeds and IP addresses. The 
first one will usually be your router, then the Internet Service Provider’s. One annotation you will see is called HOP. Hop 
is an indication however many packets have passed between a router. So, your computer can jump from state to state just to get 
to one website. RTT1, 2, and 3 refer to the time that for that information to take a round trip, from the destination back to 
the computer. This is usually referred to as latency, which I usually just refer to ping. The traceroute will do this three 
times to make sure there is consistency within the connection. I actually ran this myself on my own computer, and it was a lot 
slower than I thought it would be. I’m not sure if this is because I was on the school’s wifi (which is terrible), the website, 
or my computer. I received quite a few * characters, which indicates that the packet was probably lost. However, by the end of 
the run, I did receive the IP address for the website I was trying to reach. I’m assuming that every website is going to be unique, 
depending on what kind of servers they have set up.
