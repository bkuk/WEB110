	Bitbucket is a collaborative workspace and also a public version control system. This means that this website is
for editing and working changes to the file system. This website will track everything you do to your repository
and what other people do as well (if you're working on the same project). This is a great place for people
to do collaborative work, which is why many professionals will use this (or github). My older brother is actually
in front end development, and he actually uses github with his coworkers as they work on building their websites.
In our case, we're going to be using this to turn in our assignemtns and codes and the teacher will be able to 
fix or make comments to them. I also use github for CIS 106, which has a very similar format to this class. Bitbucket
github are very similar in functinality. They were created for the same purpose, however I do prefer using github.
