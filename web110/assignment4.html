Email is an electronic form of mail that was first created in the 1960s. Since then, email is arguably one of the most used forms of contact today.
To start, for people to email each other, they will both need email addresses. They can do this by creating an email through an email provider; this
includes Gmail, Yahoo!, Microsoft Outlook, etc. All email providers will all have the same function, which is providing you with an email address and
additional email features. It is just a matter of preference on which email one would like to choose. Overall, most email providers today will have similar
functions. For example, other than just sending emails, people can have access to online chatting or calendars through their provider. Providers today do
not only limit themselves to just being able to send one letter at a time. There are many advantages to having an electronic address rather than sending
real letters through the mail. For example, most Gmail has an interesting function where it will group together a conversation that you are having with
someone. Rather than just having the emails all over the screen, the conversation will be grouped into a single flowing messaging system. This helps with
the organization of the messages that you receive. There are also aspects of email that people have to be careful with. For example, spam is something that
most people receive. Spam is just unwanted advertising. This can flood an email account and make everything clutter. Thankfully, most email providers have
filters for this. Most spam mail will not usually make it to the primary inbox and into a spam folder automatically. Spam can be filtered, however phishing
is a bit more dangerous. Phishing is the act of someone posing as a legitimate source/company. They will try to take advantage of appearing to be legit to
get information from people. Sometimes, these emails are difficult to point out. They may create logos or try to use emails that closely resemble real
companies. However, one big clue to spotting these is to see if they are asking for very personal information. Almost no one will ask you to submit your
social security or your bank account through an email. When they ask for this kind of information, it is a good idea to find out if it is real or not. After
completing the tutorial for creating and sending emails, it was interesting to break down emails after using them for all my life. For example, I had no idea
what cc meant. I always had an idea that it was just to add other recipients, but it was interesting to discover that it was meant for other people who are not the main recipient.
