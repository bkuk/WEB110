This chapter was rather exciting, it focuses on the introduction of HTML and creating web pages. I have a tiny bit of experience in html myself,
but it was mostly what was taught in this lesson. My main takeaway from this lesson was pretty much how to create a web page, although they also
went through the process of how a website is used. One of the activities involved just getting familiar with HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
There was one website I thought was really helpful, which was the W3 school HTML Introduction. It breaks down a simple page with a title and body
and runs through what a basic website structure may look like. It goes through what you need, what they do, and what you can do. This website is
a good summary of what they talk about in the video for this chapter. Another website went through the different tags that can be used. This is
one of the most important parts, because the tags used on a website control what everything may look like or how they’re positioned. There’s
another activity that actually takes you to build your own website with the online HTML editor. I actually really enjoyed the editor, before
I was using repl.it for a different programming class. The editor is nice because you can edit in both the source code and the web page itself.
In repl.it, you can only edit the source code and run the code over and over again. Overall, it was a great, engaging activity. It really makes
students play with the language and figure out how to position or do something. It’s almost like working with a program like photoshop, except
you are manipulating lines of text rather than the object itself. The last assignment was titled validating your web page, which is basically
just debugging the code so that there are no errors or anything. I’ve used Python and C++ debuggers before, so it’s interesting to see that
there is one for so detailed for HTML as well.
