The activities in this session mostly revolved around creating different social media accounts and what they are for. This includes services
such as Facebook, Instagram, Pintrist and a few others. These are all accounts that anyone can make and most of them only require an email
address. However, what’s interesting is what you can do with these accounts today. There are many different ways to relay information nowadays.
For personal use, many people will use services like Facebook or Instagram to share what is happening in their daily lives. For example, one
can share a wedding album on Facebook to show to all their online friends. You can do the same on Instagram. However, social media does not
only apply to personal use. Today, many businesses will have a Facebook or Instagram page. This is to create their presence. Social media
is a much easier way to get a name out there. LinkedIn is actually a service for professional networking. Many people will create an account
to put their name out there or share their professional experience as a form of online resume. This does not just apply to a single person,
businesses will do something like this as well. By creating these accounts, these businesses can basically interact with people online. They
can do this by posting updates in what’s happening or giving general information in their account description. Fifteen years ago, I thought
this idea was silly. But, people really can make money from social media. Many of the influencers on these services will receive sponsorships.
These are just companies paying these people to tell their audience about them. With this, these companies can really capitalize on other’s
fame to put their name out there. The honeycomb framework was also interesting. They are all attributes of what makes a good social media
presence put into a chart. It was interesting to see someone break this down to a science.
