            Creating a Basic HTML File
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />

    <body>
        <p>
            The first step is to create an html file. This is very simple, just open up a text editor and save it as something.html. This will tell the computer that it is saved as an HTML file. I included this step because it was not very obvious to me how to start the web development process and because step one is the most important.
        </p>
        <p>
            We then need to tell the file that we are going to be writing in HTML. We can do this by including a "!DOCTYPE html" in angle brackets at the top of the file. This is basically telling the file that HTML is going to be written in the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, something that needs to be understood before we move on is tags. HTML documents are made up of tags, and they are composed of elements, which is the content within the tags. Every tag is going to have an opening and closing element. That will look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="paragraph.png" alt="Paragraph Tag"/>
        <p>
            This example will create a paragraph that has the word, “something,” in it. Each tag will have a specific purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, if we are going to write in HTML, we need to include a HTML opening and closing tag. That will look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="html tag.png" alt="HTML Tag"/>
        <p>
            This is going to wrap around everything that we are going to write in HTML. This is telling the file that everything inside is meant to be HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I said before, think of an HTML file as the body of a website. So the body is going to have a head and a body. We’re going to include opening and closing head and body tags. The head is going to contain the meta information of the document. Meta information is information about information. For example, like the subject or the title. The body is going to include all the content of the page. Now, we’re going to include these tags inside our html tags. This will look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="head body.png" alt="Head and Body"/>
        <p>
            With this, the set up is complete. You have completed the setup of a basic HTML file!
