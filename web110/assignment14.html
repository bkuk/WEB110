            For the final project, I plan to create a website that shows the basic fundamentals of the HTML language. I will go over what you need to know before starting, an introduction to the language, and some additional information and resources that may be helpful for learning HTML. I would rather apply the knowledge I learned in class rather than present it. I have done introductions to HTML on a few different sites, and they are all relatively the same. HTML is a rather easy language to learn and understand, so I think I can do a great job introducing it to someone else.

            In this session, we discussed how project management plays into effect in business. So, when a company decides to take on a project, it means that they are working on something temporarily. Versus an operation, which is a repetitive process (factories that make the same part over and over). There are some important factors that one must think about when dealing with project management: scope, time, budget, and quality. Scope is the overall process that one needs to think about to complete the project. What needs to be done? How long will it take? How will you get to the end? Time refers to how long it will take to complete each step of the process. Budget refers to how much the project is going to cost. How much does the client want to spend on the project? Finally the quality refers to how consistent the production is. With this given information, we were asked to create gantt charts to project our final projects. A gantt chart is a bar chart that gives an image of the project schedule. In my chart, I included tasks that needed to be done, how long they would take, and the progress of the task. I did this all while thinking about what I need to do for the final project and the time constraints I have until May 10. This whole chapter was interesting because it is similar to what I am learning in GRA 101. This class focuses mainly on printing projects, however the process to accepting and working on a project is very similar. In GRA, heavily refer back to the project manager because he/she ensures the quality of the whole project. You can say the same about web design. Even the attributes that you have to think about are the same.
